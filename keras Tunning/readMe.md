# Hyperparameter Tuning with Keras Tuner

This project demonstrates how to perform hyperparameter tuning on a neural network using **Keras Tuner**.  
The implementation is based on the concepts explained in [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/oYnyNLj8RMA?feature=shared).

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Build a simple neural network model using Keras.
- Use **Keras Tuner** to find the best hyperparameters for the model.
- Train, evaluate, and compare tuned models.

## ⚙️ Features

- **RandomSearch Tuner**: Optimizes hyperparameters through random search.
- **Configurable Hyperparameters**:
  - Number of dense units.
  - Activation functions.
  - Optimizer type and learning rate.
- **Validation Monitoring**: Tracks validation accuracy for best model selection.
- **Best Model Export**: Saves the best-performing model.
