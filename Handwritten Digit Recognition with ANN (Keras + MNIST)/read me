ðŸ–‹ Handwritten Digit Recognition with ANN (Keras + MNIST)
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project uses the famous MNIST dataset to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that can recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

Dataset Size: 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits
Image Size: 28 Ã— 28 pixels
Training Data: 60,000 images
Testing Data: 10,000 images
Think of it like teaching a child to recognize numbers â€” first we show thousands of examples (training), then we test with new ones (testing) to see how well they learned.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset
The MNIST dataset is built into Keras and can be loaded easily:

from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
