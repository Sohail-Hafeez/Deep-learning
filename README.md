# Deep Learning Journey

Welcome to my deep learning learning repo!  
This repository documents my progress, experiments, and projects as I dive into the world of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

## About
I am currently learning deep learning with a focus on:
- Neural Networks (ANNs, CNNs, RNNs)
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Model Training and Optimization
- Using frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch

## Repository Contents
- Notebooks: Practice notebooks and experiments from my deep learning journey.
- Projects: Mini-projects implementing concepts I learn.
- Notes: Explanations and summaries for quick revision.

## Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Deep Learning.
- Implement classic architectures (MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM).
- Work on real-world datasets.
- Contribute to open-source AI projects.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- PyTorch

## Progress
- [x] Basics of Neural Networks  
- [ ] Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  
- [ ] Natural Language Processing  
- [ ] Advanced Architectures (Transformers, GANs)
